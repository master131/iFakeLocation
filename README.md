## Requirements:

### Windows:

- iTunes (Microsoft Store version or Win32/Win64 is fine)  
  https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/

## Download:

See the [Releases](https://github.com/master131/iFakeLocation/releases) page.

## Running:

### Windows:

Run the executable called iFakeLocation.exe.

### Mac OSX

```
chmod +x ./iFakeLocation
./iFakeLocation
```

### Ubuntu

```
chmod +x ./iFakeLocation
./iFakeLocation
```

## How to use:

- Connect your iDevice to your computer. Click the "Refresh" button and select your iDevice from the list.

- Enter the desired location (ie. Sydney NSW) in the box and hit "Search" (try to be
  more specific if you are getting strange results).

  You can also manually place a pin on the map by double-clicking anywhere.

- Click "Set Fake Location". If it is the first time doing this the tool
  needs to download some files to enable Developer Mode on your iDevice.

- Confirm your fake location using Apple Maps, Google Maps, etc. To stop the fake location,
  click "Stop Fake Location". If your device is still stuck at the faked location
  turn Location Services off and on in Settings > Privacy.

- Your device will also have a Developer menu now shown in Settings. You can get rid of it
  by restarting your iDevice.

## Help:

Q: My device doesn't show up on the list?  
A: Ensure that it is plugged in, you have trusted your PC and that the device is visible on iTunes.

Q: Help, it says that it can't mount the image or some other generic error?  
A: Make sure your iDevice is trusted with the PC/Mac and if everything you've tried is not working, usually a reboot of your device will fix the issue
